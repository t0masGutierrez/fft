# Fast Fourier Transform

Fourier analysis is a method for expressing a function as a sum of periodic components, and for recovering the function from those components.  When both the function and its Fourier transform are replaced with discretized components, it is called the discrete Fourier transform (DFT).  The DFT has become popular within numerical computing partly because of a very fast algorithm for computing it, called the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), which was known to Gauss (1805) and was popularized in its current form by Cooley and Tukey, providing an accessible introduction to Fourier analysis and its applications. Because the discrete Fourier transform separates its input into components that contribute at discrete frequencies, it has a great number of applications in digital signal processing. For example, filtering, and in this context the discretized input of the transform is customarily referred to as a signal, which exists in the time domain.  The output is called a spectrum or transform and exists in the frequency domain [1].
