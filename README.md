# Fast Fourier Transform

Fourier analysis is fundamentally a method for expressing a function as a
sum of periodic components, and for recovering the function from those components.  When both the function and its Fourier transform are replaced with discretized counterparts, it is called the discrete Fourier transform (DFT).  The DFT has become a mainstay of numerical computing in part because of a very fast algorithm for computing it, called the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), which was known to Gauss (1805) and was brought to light in its current form by Cooley and Tukey et al. provide an accessible introduction to Fourier analysis and its applications. Because the discrete Fourier transform separates its input into components that contribute at discrete frequencies, it has a great number of applications in digital signal processing, e.g., for filtering, and in this context the discretized input to the transform is customarily referred to as a *signal*, which exists in the *time domain*.  The output is called a *spectrum* or *transform* and exists in the *frequency domain*.
